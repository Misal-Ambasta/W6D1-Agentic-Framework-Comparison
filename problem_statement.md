## Requirements

- Create a comparison table rating frameworks on:
  - Core capabilities
  - Ease of use
  - Customization flexibility
  - Setup complexity
  - Performance
  - Scalability
  - Cost effectiveness
  - Development speed

- Build a simple agentic workflow example using:
  - One **code-based framework**
  - One **no-code framework**

- Document the development process and challenges
