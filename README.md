        'priority': 'medium',
        'category': 'customer_support'
    }
    response = requests.post('https://api.company.com/tickets', 
                           json=ticket_data)
    return f"Ticket created: #{response.json()['ticket_id']}"

# Initialize tools
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Knowledge Base Search",
        func=search_knowledge_base,
        description="Search company knowledge base for solutions"
    ),

# Initialize memory for conversation context
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(
    memory_key="chat_history",
    return_messages=True
)

# Create the agent
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True

## Cost Considerations

### Code-Based Frameworks
- **Initial Investment**: High (development time, infrastructure)
- **Ongoing Costs**: Infrastructure, maintenance, model usage
- **Scaling Costs**: Predictable infrastructure scaling
- **Hidden Costs**: Development team, ongoing maintenance

### No-Code Frameworks
- **Initial Investment**: Low (subscription fees)
- **Ongoing Costs**: Per-execution or monthly subscription fees
- **Scaling Costs**: Can become expensive at high volumes
- **Hidden Costs**: Platform lock-in, limited customization needs

---

## Conclusion

The choice between code-based and no-code agentic frameworks depends heavily on organizational needs, technical capabilities, and long-term objectives. Code-based solutions offer superior customization and scalability but require significant technical investment. No-code platforms provide rapid deployment and ease of use but may face limitations in complex scenarios.

For most organizations, a hybrid approach works best: starting with no-code solutions for rapid prototyping and simple workflows, then migrating to code-based frameworks as requirements become more sophisticated and scale demands increase.

**Final Recommendations:**
1. **Start Small**: Begin with no-code solutions to validate concepts
2. **Plan for Growth**: Consider migration paths to code-based solutions
3. **Assess Technical Capacity**: Honestly evaluate available technical resources
4. **Consider Total Cost**: Include development, maintenance, and scaling costs
5. **Evaluate Vendor Lock-in**: Understand dependencies and exit strategies
